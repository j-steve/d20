Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\nAs an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\nYou can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.\nFinally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your action modifier for the roll."

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.\nYou initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.\nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.\nOnce you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range."

On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nThe phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature. The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example. a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall-it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.\nAn affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn. the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion."

If you choose a\nsurface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in\ndiameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the\nobject is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken,\nand the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible and\nrequires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell\nsave DC to be found. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the\nspell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include\ntouching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching\nwithin a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the\nglyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers\ninclude opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the\nobject, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell\nends. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under\ncertain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height\nor weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect\naberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures\nthat don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When\nyou inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\nExplosive Runes. When\ntriggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred\non the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must\nmake a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire,\nlightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you\ncreate the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSpell Glyph. You\ncan store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as\npart of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area.\nThe spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the\nglyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it\ntargets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area,\nthe area is centred on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or\ncreates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the\nintruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the\nend of its full duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this\nspell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive\nrunes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a\nspell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot\nyou use for the glyph of warding."

Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\nAt higher levels.

Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to\nfive questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the\nlanguages it knew.

This spell doesn’t return the creature’s\nsoul to its body, only its animating spirit.

On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8\nbludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until\nthe spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes\nhalf damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature\ncaught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim\naway from the vortex as described above, but has\ndisadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first time each turn that an object enters the\nvortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this\ndamage occurs each round it remains in the vortex."

You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.

The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell. When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects. \nGuards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.\nCorridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.\nDoors. All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall. Stairs. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.\nOther Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.\n• Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.\n• Place magic mouth in two locations.\n• Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.\n• Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.\n• Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. The whole warded area radiates magic. \nA dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.\nYou can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year."

If you know a specific\ncreature’s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request\nthat creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM’s choice).

The requested task could range from simple (fly us\nacross the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or\nprotect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate\nwith the creature to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety of\nforms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an\nallied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of\ntreasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by\nyou. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a\npayment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per\nhour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day.\nThe DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you\ncast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might\nbe halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the\nsuggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater\ngift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After the creature\ncompletes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the\ncreature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate\nto the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the\ncreature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane. A\ncreature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full\nshare of experience points awarded."

			"description": "When you cast this spell, you inscribe a\nharmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section o f floor, a wall, or a\ntable) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a\nbook, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can\ncover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose\nan object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more\nthan 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell\nends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an\nIntelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You\ndecide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on\na surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph,\nremoving another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of\nit, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an\nobject, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a\ncertain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. You can further refine\nthe trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or\naccording to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight),\nor physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or\nshapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph,\nsuch as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose\none of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling\na 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the\nspell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by\nits effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a\nturn or ends its turn there.\nDeath. Each\ntarget must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d 10 necrotic damage on\na failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nDiscord. Each\ntarget must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target\nbickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is\nincapable o f meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and\nability checks.\nFear. Each\ntarget must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a\nfailed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must\nmove at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\nHopelessness. Each\ntarget must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed\nwith despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any\ncreature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\nInsanity. Each\ntarget must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is\ndriven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can't understand\nwhat other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM\ncontrols its movement, which is erratic.\nPain. Each\ntarget must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with\nexcruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\nSleep. Each\ntarget must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on\na failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an\naction to shake or slap it awake.\nStunning.

The DM\ndetermines the direction off target randomly by rolling a\nd8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east,\nand so on around the points of the compass. If you were\nteleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out\nat sea, you could be in trouble.\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target\nobject) wind up in a different area that’s visually or\nthematically similar to the target area.

Generally,\nyou appear in the closest similar place, but since the\nspell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up\nanywhere on the plane.\nMishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a\ndifficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target\nobject) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on\nthe table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps\ncan occur, dealing damage each time)."

While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target. When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.\nBurial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.\nChaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\nHedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\nMinimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\nSlumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell\nconsists of rare soporific herbs.\nEnding the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it. You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding."

If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted. \n  The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100  feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. \n  The wall consists of seven layers, each with a  different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below. \n  The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time,  in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it. \n1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it. \n2. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind. \n3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it. \n4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. \n5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it. \n6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. \n  While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast  through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level. \n7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects."

If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hitpoints, you aren’t knocked unconscious. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak. When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state. During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.\nPage: 274 Players Handbook"

You transform the creature into\na different creature, the creature into an object, or the\nobject into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation\nlasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full\nduration, the transformation becomes permanent.\nShapechangers aren’t affected by this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell. \nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including\nmental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of\nthe new form. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form,\nand when it reverts to its normal form, the creature\nreturns to the number of hit points it had before it\ntransformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to\n0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t\nreduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t\nknocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by\nthe nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells,\nor take any other action that requires hands or speech\nunless its new form is capable of such actions.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The\ncreature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit\nfrom any of its equipment.\nObject into Creature. You can turn an object into\nany kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size\nis no larger than the object’s size and the creature’s\nchallenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to\nyou and your companions. It acts on each of your turns.\nYou decide what action it takes and how it moves. The\nDM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its\nactions and movement.\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control\nthe creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending\non how you have treated it.\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into an\nobject, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing\nand carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory o f time spent in this form, after the spell ends\nand it returns to its normal form."

			"description": "Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension , and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make your self and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\n• You undo a single recent event by forcing a re-roll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. \nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish . For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. \nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress."
